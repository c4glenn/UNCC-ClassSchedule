This mobility establishes dynamic foodways and gives rise to new food landscapes through which we can understand temporally connected sites of intense interaction. This writing intensive course unpacks these processes through investigating the dynamics of food production and consumption in a transnational world. Recognizing the centrality of culinary culture in migrant identities, this course focuses on the role of food habits, rituals, and practices in producing and sustaining shared identities and places. Students gain an understanding of these relations through engagement with case studies and literature addressing the complex spaces we inhabit in a transnational world.",
